# Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,
# A tale of a fateful trip
# That started from this tropic port
# Aboard this tiny ship.

# The mate was a mighty sailing man,
# The skipper brave and sure.
# Five passengers set sail that day
# For a three hour tour, a three hour tour.

# The weather started getting rough,
# The tiny ship was tossed,
# If not for the courage of the fearless crew
# The minnow would be lost, the minnow would be lost.

# The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle
# With Gilligan
# The Skipper too,
# The millionaire and his wife,
# The movie star
# The professor and Mary Ann,
# Here on Gilligans Isle.

# So this is the tale of the castaways,
# They're here for a long, long time,
# They'll have to make the best of things,
# It's an uphill climb.

# The first mate and the Skipper too,
# Will do their very best,
# To make the others comfortable,
# In the tropic island nest.

# No phone, no lights no motor cars,
# Not a single luxury,
# Like Robinson Crusoe,
# As primative as can be.

# So join us here each week my friends,
# You're sure to get a smile,
# From seven stranded castaways,
# Here on "Gilligan's Isle."
